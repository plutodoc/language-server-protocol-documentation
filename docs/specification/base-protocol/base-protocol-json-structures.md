# Base Protocol JSON structures

The following TypeScript definitions describe the base [JSON-RPC protocol](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification):

## Base Types

The protocol use the following definitions for integers, unsigned integers, decimal numbers, objects and arrays:

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#integer" name="integer" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * Defines an integer number in the range of -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.
 */
export type integer = number;
```

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#uinteger" name="uinteger" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * Defines an unsigned integer number in the range of 0 to 2^31 - 1.
 */
export type uinteger = number;
```

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#decimal" name="decimal" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * Defines a decimal number. Since decimal numbers are very
 * rare in the language server specification we denote the
 * exact range with every decimal using the mathematics
 * interval notation (e.g. [0, 1] denotes all decimals d with
 * 0 <= d <= 1.
 */
export type decimal = number;
```

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#lspAny" name="lspAny" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * The LSP any type
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type LSPAny = LSPObject | LSPArray | string | integer | uinteger |
	decimal | boolean | null;
```

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#lspObject" name="lspObject" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * LSP object definition.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type LSPObject = { [key: string]: LSPAny };
```

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#lspArray" name="lspArray" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * LSP arrays.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type LSPArray = LSPAny[];
```

## Abstract Message

A general message as defined by JSON-RPC. The language server protocol always uses "2.0" as the `jsonrpc` version.

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#message" name="message" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
interface Message {
	jsonrpc: string;
}
```

## Request Message

A request message to describe a request between the client and the server. Every processed request must send a response back to the sender of the request.

```typescript
interface RequestMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: integer | string;
	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;
	/**
	 * The method's params.
	 */
	params?: array | object;
}
```

## Response Message

A Response Message sent as a result of a request. If a request doesn't provide a result value the receiver of a request still needs to return a response message to conform to the JSON-RPC specification. The result property of the ResponseMessage should be set to `null` in this case to signal a successful request.

```typescript
interface ResponseMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: integer | string | null;
	/**
	 * The result of a request. This member is REQUIRED on success.
	 * This member MUST NOT exist if there was an error invoking the method.
	 */
	result?: string | number | boolean | object | null;
	/**
	 * The error object in case a request fails.
	 */
	error?: ResponseError;
}
```

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#responseError" name="responseError" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
interface ResponseError {
	/**
	 * A number indicating the error type that occurred.
	 */
	code: integer;
	/**
	 * A string providing a short description of the error.
	 */
	message: string;
	/**
	 * A primitive or structured value that contains additional
	 * information about the error. Can be omitted.
	 */
	data?: string | number | boolean | array | object | null;
}
```

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#errorCodes" name="errorCodes" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
export namespace ErrorCodes {
	// Defined by JSON-RPC
	export const ParseError: integer = -32700;
	export const InvalidRequest: integer = -32600;
	export const MethodNotFound: integer = -32601;
	export const InvalidParams: integer = -32602;
	export const InternalError: integer = -32603;
	/**
	 * This is the start range of JSON-RPC reserved error codes.
	 * It doesn't denote a real error code. No LSP error codes should
	 * be defined between the start and end range. For backwards
	 * compatibility the `ServerNotInitialized` and the `UnknownErrorCode`
	 * are left in the range.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	export const jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeStart: integer = -32099;
	/** @deprecated use jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeStart */
	export const serverErrorStart: integer = jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeStart;
	/**
	 * Error code indicating that a server received a notification or
	 * request before the server has received the `initialize` request.
	 */
	export const ServerNotInitialized: integer = -32002;
	export const UnknownErrorCode: integer = -32001;
	/**
	 * This is the end range of JSON-RPC reserved error codes.
	 * It doesn't denote a real error code.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	export const jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeEnd = -32000;
	/** @deprecated use jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeEnd */
	export const serverErrorEnd: integer = jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeEnd;
	/**
	 * This is the start range of LSP reserved error codes.
	 * It doesn't denote a real error code.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	export const lspReservedErrorRangeStart: integer = -32899;
	/**
	 * A request failed but it was syntactically correct, e.g the
	 * method name was known and the parameters were valid. The error
	 * message should contain human readable information about why
	 * the request failed.
	 *
	 * @since 3.17.0
	 */
	export const RequestFailed: integer = -32803;
	/**
	 * The server cancelled the request. This error code should
	 * only be used for requests that explicitly support being
	 * server cancellable.
	 *
	 * @since 3.17.0
	 */
	export const ServerCancelled: integer = -32802;
	/**
	 * The server detected that the content of a document got
	 * modified outside normal conditions. A server should
	 * NOT send this error code if it detects a content change
	 * in it unprocessed messages. The result even computed
	 * on an older state might still be useful for the client.
	 *
	 * If a client decides that a result is not of any use anymore
	 * the client should cancel the request.
	 */
	export const ContentModified: integer = -32801;
	/**
	 * The client has canceled a request and a server as detected
	 * the cancel.
	 */
	export const RequestCancelled: integer = -32800;
	/**
	 * This is the end range of LSP reserved error codes.
	 * It doesn't denote a real error code.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	export const lspReservedErrorRangeEnd: integer = -32800;
}
```
## Notification Message

A notification message. A processed notification message must not send a response back. They work like events.

```typescript
interface NotificationMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;
	/**
	 * The notification's params.
	 */
	params?: array | object;
}
```


## $ Notifications and Requests

Notification and requests whose methods start with '\$/' are messages which are protocol implementation dependent and might not be implementable in all clients or servers. For example if the server implementation uses a single threaded synchronous programming language then there is little a server can do to react to a `$/cancelRequest` notification. If a server or client receives notifications starting with '\$/' it is free to ignore the notification. If a server or client receives a request starting with '\$/' it must error the request with error code `MethodNotFound` (e.g. `-32601`).

## Cancellation Support (:arrow_right: :arrow_left:)

The base protocol offers support for request cancellation. To cancel a request, a notification message with the following properties is sent:

_Notification_:
* method: '$/cancelRequest'
* params: `CancelParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface CancelParams {
	/**
	 * The request id to cancel.
	 */
	id: integer | string;
}
```

A request that got canceled still needs to return from the server and send a response back. It can not be left open / hanging. This is in line with the JSON-RPC protocol that requires that every request sends a response back. In addition it allows for returning partial results on cancel. If the request returns an error response on cancellation it is advised to set the error code to `ErrorCodes.RequestCancelled`.

## Progress Support (:arrow_right: :arrow_left:)

The base protocol offers also support to report progress in a generic fashion. This mechanism can be used to report any kind of progress including work done progress (usually used to report progress in the user interface using a progress bar) and partial result progress to support streaming of results.

A progress notification has the following properties:

_Notification_:
* method: '$/progress'
* params: `ProgressParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
type ProgressToken = integer | string;
```

```typescript
interface ProgressParams<T> {
	/**
	 * The progress token provided by the client or server.
	 */
	token: ProgressToken;
	/**
	 * The progress data.
	 */
	value: T;
}
```

Progress is reported against a token. The token is different than the request ID which allows to report progress out of band and also for notification.
